## React Apple

React Apple makes your code better because Apple makes the world better!

## How to install:

```bash
npm install react-apple --save
```

## Usage

```javascript
const Apple = require('react-apple');
```

```javascript
<Apple>
  // code that you want make better
</Apple>
```

By default Apple component has awesome `className="apple"`. But it can help customize and your boring className too. If you want to change it just pass the custom `className` property to component. For example:

```javascript
<Apple className="macbook">
  // code that you want make better
</Apple>
```

And you will have a magic inside your html:

```html
<div class="apple-macbook">
  ...
</div>
```
